# Feature Scaling

# ‚öñÔ∏è Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)

## üîπ What it is
Normalization (also called **Min-Max Scaling**) is a feature scaling technique used to bring all numerical features to a **common scale**, usually between **0 and 1**.  
This ensures that no feature dominates due to its range.

---

## üîπ Why it is important
Normalization is important for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of data, such as:  

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Neural Networks**  
- **Gradient descent-based models**  

---

## üîπ Formula
The formula for Min-Max scaling is:  

\[
X_{norm} = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}
\]

Where:  
- \(X\) = original value  
- \(X_{min}\) = minimum value in the feature  
- \(X_{max}\) = maximum value in the feature  
- \(X_{norm}\) = normalized value (between 0 and 1)  

---

## üîπ Example with Formula Applied

Suppose we have a feature **Age**:

| Age |
|-----|
| 20  |
| 30  |
| 40  |
| 60  |

1. Identify minimum and maximum:  
   - \(X_{min} = 20\)  
   - \(X_{max} = 60\)  

2. Apply the formula for each value:

\[
X_{norm} = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}
\]

- For 20: \( (20-20)/(60-20) = 0/40 = 0 \)  
- For 30: \( (30-20)/(60-20) = 10/40 = 0.25 \)  
- For 40: \( (40-20)/(60-20) = 20/40 = 0.5 \)  
- For 60: \( (60-20)/(60-20) = 40/40 = 1 \)  

**Normalized Ages:** `[0, 0.25, 0.5, 1]`

# StandardScaler in Machine Learning

## üîπ What is StandardScaler?

`StandardScaler` standardizes the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. After scaling:

- **Mean** = 0  
- **Standard Deviation** = 1  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is different from `MinMaxScaler`, which scales data to a fixed range, usually [0,1].

---

## üîπ Formula

\[
X_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

Where:  
- \(X\) = original value  
- \(\mu\) = mean of the data  
- \(\sigma\) = standard deviation of the data  

---

## üîπ Step-by-Step Example

### Original Data
### Step 1: Calculate the Mean (\(\mu\))
\[
\mu = \frac{2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 6}{5} = 4.4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Standard Deviation (\(\sigma\))
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{(2-4.4)^2 + (3-4.4)^2 + (5-4.4)^2 + (6-4.4)^2 + (6-4.4)^2}{5}}
\]

\[
\sigma \approx 1.6248
\]

### Step 3: Standardize Each Value
\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

| Original \(X\) | Standardized \(Z\) |
|----------------|------------------|
| 2              | -1.477           |
| 3              | -0.862           |
| 5              | 0.369            |
| 6              | 0.985            |
| 6              | 0.985            |

### Step 4: Final Output
[[-1.4770999 ]
[-0.86164044]
[ 0.36944548]
[ 0.98485496]
[ 0.98485496]]

----

## üîπ Summary

| Scaler          | Range / Centering |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| MinMaxScaler    | Scales values to [0,1] |
| StandardScaler  | Centers data around 0 with standard deviation 1 |

---

## üîπ When to Use

Use `StandardScaler` when you want your features to have **similar scale** and be **centered around 0**.  
This is important for algorithms like:  

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Logistic Regression  
- Neural Networks

- Reduce **training time**

---

### üîπ Examples of Feature Selection Methods

1. **Correlation-based Selection**  
   - **Idea:** Remove features that are highly correlated with each other.  
   - **Why:** Highly correlated features provide redundant information.  
   - **Example:** If `Height` and `Arm Length` are highly correlated, you can drop one.

2. **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**  
   - **Idea:** Recursively remove the least important features based on model performance.  
   - **Process:**  
     1. Train a model  
     2. Rank features by importance  
     3. Remove the least important feature  
     4. Repeat until desired number of features remain  
   - **Example:** Use RFE with a logistic regression model to select top 5 predictors for heart disease.

3. **Tree-based Feature Importance**  
   - **Idea:** Decision trees and ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) can rank features by their contribution to reducing error.  
   - **Example:** Train a Random Forest classifier and select the top 10 features with highest importance scores.

- **Example:** Age data `[18, 22, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]`  
  - Range = 45 - 18 = 27  
  - 3 bins ‚Üí width = 27 / 3 = 9  
  - Bins: 18‚Äì27, 27‚Äì36, 36‚Äì45  
  - Resulting categories: `[18‚Äì27, 18‚Äì27, 18‚Äì27, 27‚Äì36, 27‚Äì36, 36‚Äì45, 36‚Äì45]`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Equal Frequency Binning
- **Idea:** Divide the values so that **each bin contains the same number of data points**.  
- **Example:** Age data `[18, 22, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]`  
  - 3 bins ‚Üí ~2‚Äì3 values per bin  
  - Bins: `[18, 22, 25]`, `[30, 35]`, `[40, 45]`  
  - Resulting categories: `[Bin1, Bin1, Bin1, Bin2, Bin2, Bin3, Bin3]`

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why Treat Outliers?
- Outliers can **skew mean, standard deviation, and correlations**.  
- They may **mislead machine learning models**, especially sensitive ones like Linear Regression or KNN.  
- Helps improve **accuracy, stability, and reliability** of models.  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Common Methods to Treat Outliers

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Removal**
- **Idea:** Remove data points that are clearly outliers.  
- **Use Case:** Small datasets or when the outlier is clearly an **error**.  
- **Example (IQR Method):**  
```python
import pandas as pd

Q1 = df['Age'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['Age'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1

df = df[(df['Age'] >= Q1 - 1.5*IQR) & (df['Age'] <= Q3 + 1.5*IQR)]
